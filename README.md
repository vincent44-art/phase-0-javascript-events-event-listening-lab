# JavaScript Event Listeners Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create event listeners on DOM nodes using `addEventListener()`

## Introduction

In this lab we will learn how to teach nodes to "listen" for an event using
`addEventListener()`.

If you haven't already, **fork and clone** this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code.


### Checking the Code in the Browser

We know that the code works in the console and passes the test, but we should
also check our changes to `index.js` in the browser. Because you've added the
`addEventListener()` function _inside_ the `addingEventListener()` function,
recall that you will need to call the outer function in `index.js` to execute
`addEventListener()` and activate the event listener. Be sure to refresh the
page to load the new code in `index.js`.
